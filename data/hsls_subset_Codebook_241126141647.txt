Name:       X1RACE
Position:   392
Length:     2
Label:      X1 Student's race/ethnicity-composite

Description:
X1RACE characterizes the sample member's race/ethnicity by summarizing the following six dichotomous race/ethnicity composites: X1HISPANIC, X1WHITE, X1BLACK, X1ASIAN, X1PACISLE, and X1AMINDIAN. The dichotomous race/ethnicity composites are based on data from the student questionnaire, if available; if not available from the student questionnaire, they are based on, in order of preference, data from the school-provided sampling roster or data from the parent questionnaire. X1RACE is derived from the six dichotomous race/ethnicity variables listed above (though the imputed values of X1WHITE, X1BLACK, X1ASIAN, X1PACISLE, and X1AMINDIAN are not stored on the data file). If  any of these input variables are imputed, then the imputation flag for X1RACE (X1RACE _IM) is set to 1.

Name:       X1TXMTH
Position:   420
Length:     7
Label:      X1 Mathematics theta score

Description:
The math theta score represents the student's ability level on a continuous scale.   The theta score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (fall 2009 9th graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated scale score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items).  When the score is not available, X1TXMTH1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X1TXMTH.  X1TXMTH is the mean of X1TXMTH1-5.  The  standard error of measurement for the theta score is X1TXMSEM. The standardized form of the mathematics theta score is X1TXMTSCOR. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math theta score.

Length:     2
Label:      X1 Mathematics quintile score

Description:
The math quintile score is a norm-referenced measure of achievement. The quintile score divides the weighted (population estimate) achievement distributions into five equal groups, based on math score (X1TXMTSCOR). Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest-achieving one-fifth of the population, quintile 5 the highest. To determine the quintile cut-points, the weighted distribution of the standardized scores was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. Cut points were matched to unrounded standardized scores. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math quintile score.

Description:
Indicates the relationship of "parent #2" to the sample member; "parent #2" is the parent to whom all "parent #2" variables (e.g. X1P2RELATION, X1PAR2EMP, P1YRBORN2, P1USYR2, etc.) refer. Parent #2 is usually the spouse/partner of the respondent unless the respondent is not a parent or parent figure and there are two parents also living in the household.  X1P2RELATION is taken from the base year parent questionnaire; if missing from the base year parent questionnaire, X1P2RELATION is statistically imputed for cases with a completed parent interview (imputed values in X1P2RELATION can be identified using X1P2RELAT_IM).


Non-partner guardian relationships recoded as other guardian on the public use file. ("Other guardian" includes foster parent, partner, grandparent, and other relative, as well as other guardian.)

Length:     7
Label:      X1 Socio-economic status composite

Description:
This composite variable is used to measure a construct for socioeconomic status. X1SES is calculated using parent/guardians' education (X1PAR1EDU and X1PAR2EDU), occupation (X1PAR1OCC2 and X1PAR2OCC2), and family income (X1FAMINCOME). For cases with nonresponding parent/guardians, 5 imputed values are generated (X1SES1-X1SES5), X1SES is computed as the average of the 5 imputed values, and the imputation flag is set as X1SES_IM=1 (values for parent/guardian education, occupation, and income are set to -8). When education, occupation, or family income are imputed using other information provided by the responding parent/guardian, X1SES is constructed from the combination of actual and imputed parent/guardian values. For these cases, the values of X1SES1-X1SES5 are equivalent to X1SES and X1SES_IM=2. Otherwise, the responding parent/guardian provided responses for all input variables so that the values of X1SES1-X1SES5 are again equivalent to X1SES and X1SES_IM=0. For more information on this variable, please refer to section 7.3.2.2 and appendix k of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

Position:   596
Length:     7
Label:      X1 Socio-economic status composite derived with locale (urbanicity)

Description:
This composite variable is used to measure a construct for socioeconomic status. X1SES_U is calculated using parent/guardians' education (X1PAR1EDU and X1PAR2EDU), occupation (X1PAR1OCC2 and X1PAR2OCC2), family income (X1FAMINCOME), as well as school urbanicity (X1LOCALE). For cases with nonresponding parent/guardians, 5 imputed values of are generated (X1SES1_U-X1SES5_U), X1SES_U is computed as the average of the 5 imputed values, and the imputation flag is set as X1SES_IM=1 (values for parent/guardian education, occupation, and income are set to -8). When education, occupation, or family income are imputed using other information provided by the responding parent/guardian, X1SES_U is constructed from the combination of actual and imputed parent/guardian values. For these cases, the values of X1SES1_U-X1SES5_U are equivalent to X1SES_U and X1SES_IM=2. Otherwise, the responding parent/guardian provided responses for all input variables so that the values of X1SES1_U-X1SES5_U are again equivalent to X1SES_U and X1SES_IM=0.  For more information on this variable, please refer to section 7.3.2.2 and appendix k of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

File:       STUDENT
Name:       X1STU30OCC2
Position:   655
Length:     2
Label:      X1 Student occupation at age 30: 2-digit ONET code

Description:
X1STU30OCC2 stores the 2-digit Occupational Information Network (O*NET) code of the job the sample member expects or plans to have at age 30. The occupation text is stored in S1OCC30 and X1STU30OCC6 (6-digit code) and X1STU30OCC2 (2-digit code) are the coded versions of that occupation text.  If an occupation cannot be coded to the 6-digit level but can be coded to the 2-digit level, the 2 digit code is also stored in X1STU30OCC6 with a value of "XX0000".  See https://www.onetcenter.org/ for further information on the O*NET taxonomy.

Occupations with low counts set to uncodeable on the public use file.

Name:       X4EVRAPPCLG
Position:   2298
Length:     2
Label:      X4 Whether applied to or registered at a college

Description:
Indicates whether the respondent ever applied to or registered at a college or trade school for postsecondary enrollment.
This variable combines information from the HSLS:09 2013 Update and the HSLS second follow-up interview. If the sample member indicated having applied to or registered at any postsecondary institutions in the HSLS:09 2013 Update (S3CLGAPPNUM) they were assigned a value of 1. Sample members who did not respond to the HSLS:09 2013 Update or indicated that they had not applied or registered at the time of the interview (i.e., S4PRE_04 = 1) were assigned a value based on their responses in the second follow-up interview (S4EVERAPPLY). If they indicated in the second follow-up interview that they still had not applied or registered they are assigned a value of 0. A small number of cases in the 2013 Update or second follow-up interview indicated that they had not applied to college or trade school (S3CLGAPPNUM, S4EVERAPPLY) but also indicated that they were attending college or trade school (S4EVRATNDCLG). These cases were assigned a value of 1.


Applies to: All second follow-up respondents.

SAS Logic:
if S4PRE_04 = 0 or (S4PRE_04 = 1 and S4EVERAPPLY = -4) then do;
  if S3CLGAPPNUM > 0 or X4EVRATNDCLG = 1 then X4EVRAPPCLG = 1;

   end;

Label:      X4 Months between high school and postsecondary education

Description:
Number of months between high school departure and postsecondary entry.
This variable indicates the number of months between high school departure and postsecondary entry. For sample members who received a high school credential (i.e., high school diploma, a GED or other equivalency, or certificate of attendance; X4HSCOMPSTAT = 1 or 2) high school departure is the month and year the sample member earned this credential (X4HSCOMPDATE). For other sample members high school departure is the month and year the sample member last attended high school (S4LASTHSMO/ S4LASTHSYR). Postsecondary entry is based on the start date for the first postsecondary institution after high school (X4PS1START); for more detail, see the student-institution file variable S4IPS1 and/or the student file variable X4PS1. Respondents who started attending their first postsecondary institution more than 12 months after high school departure were asked about their reasons for delaying postsecondary enrollment in these interview items: S4BREAKACAD, S4BREAKFAM, S4BREAKFIN, S4BREAKWRK, S4BREAKNONE.

Length:     2
Label:      X4 Reference undergraduate degree or certificate program

Description:
Indicates the type of degree or certificate (e.g., bachelor's, associate, or certificate) that is the reference degree. See X4REFDEG for a definition of the reference degree.
The reference degree is the undergraduate degree or certificate the respondent was working on in February 2016 or, if no longer enrolled in February 2016, when last enrolled. The respondent may have been actively working on the reference degree in February 2016, have completed it, or stopped pursuing it. Respondents who had only enrolled in undergraduate courses outside of a degree or certificate program do not have a reference degree. The major field of study for the reference degree (X4RFDGMJ6) is the subject of S4MAJENJOY - S4MAJENCRG and S4MAJMAINRSN. S4CHGNAVAIL - S4CHGJOBRSN and S4CHGMAINRSN refer to the change of major from the intended major (S4FIELD6) to the reference degree major (X4RFDGMJ6), if applicable. Finally, S4MAJCHGNUM refers to the number of times the major changed for a reference degree that is either a bachelor's or associate's degree.

Description:
Indicates the highest credential attained at any institution, or if no credential had been attained, the level of the institution where the respondent was enrolled in February 2016.
This variable was developed to mirror variables included in NCES's Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Studies (i.e. PRLVL6Y from BPS:04/09, and PRLVL3Y and BPS:12/14).
Note: While these BPS variables examine persistence and attainment at any institution through the end of the spring term 6 and 3 years (respectively) after starting postsecondary education, X4ATPRLVLA examines persistence and attainment at any institution through February 2016.  Respondents with attainment and enrollment in February 2016 were put in the highest credential attainment category. For enrollment status in February 2016 irrespective of degree attainment see X4PSENRSTLV. For enrollment and attainment based on the first institution see X4ATPRTFI.

Label:      X4 Major considering upon postsecondary entry is in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field

Description:
Indicates whether the major the student was most seriously considering when first entering postsecondary education after high school was in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field.
Based on the major the respondent was most seriously considering when first entering postsecondary education after high school as reported during the second follow up interview (S4FIELD). This may or may not be a declared major. Majors are classified using the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs, 2010 edition (CIP 2010) and then classified as STEM using the definition used by the E.D. SMART grant. The variable S3FIELD_STEM contains similar data collected from either students or their parents in the 2013 Update. The 2013 Update collected intended field of study on the cusp of postsecondary entry or during the fall term of 2013 whereas this variable collects the intended major retrospectively. Question wording differs slightly due to temporal differences.  See also X4ENTMJSTNSF for NSF-supported STEM majors.

Description:
Categorizes the major the respondent was most seriously considering when first entering postsecondary education after high school into one of 23 categories.
Based on the major the respondent was most seriously considering when first entering postsecondary education after high school as reported during the second follow up interview (S4FIELD). This may or may not be a declared major. Majors in S4FIELD6 are aggregated into 23 categories used in NCES' BPS, B&B, and NPSAS studies. Includes intended majors for all student who had enrolled in a postsecondary institution regardless of whether they enrolled in a degree or certificate program or declared a major. Related variables X4ENTRYMAJ2Y and X4ENTRYMAJ4Y further aggregate this variable into 11 and 10 categories to assist in analyzing subbaccalaureate and baccalaureate credential seekers'/all undergraduates intended fields of study, respectively. Data on intended majors were also collected from either students or their parents in the 2013 Update, although a variable categorizing into 23 categories was not created for those data. The 2013 Update collected intended field of study on the cusp of postsecondary entry or during the fall term of 2013 whereas this variable collects the intended major retrospectively. Question wording differs slightly due to temporal differences.

Name:       X4RFDGMJ12
Position:   2403
Length:     2
Label:      X4 Reference degree major, 2 digit

Description:
Indicates the first major for the reference degree (X4REFDEG) using 2-digit CIP code. See X4REFDEG for a definition of the reference degree.
Based on the first major or field of study the respondent had declared or decided upon for the reference degree (X4REFDEG) as reported during the second follow up interview. In the case of a double major, it is the major reported first. Majors are classified using the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs, 2010 edition (CIP 2010) at both the 2-digit (X4RFDGMJ12) and the 6-digit (X4RFDGMJ16) level of specificity. For reference degrees that were bachelor's or associate's degrees that had not been completed by February 2016, see S4DECLAREMAJ to determine if the major had been declared. See X4RFDGMJ22 and X4RFDGMJ26 for the second major in the case of a double major.  X4RFDGMJ12 / X4RFDGMJ16 is the subject of S4MAJENJOY - S4MAJENCRG and S4MAJMAINRSN.

Applies to: Second follow-up respondents who ever enrolled in an undergraduate degree or certificate program after high school.

Name:       X4RFDGMJSTEM
Position:   2405
Length:     2
Label:      X4 Reference degree's first major is STEM

Description:
Reference undergraduate degree/certificate first major field of study is in a science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) field. See X4REFDEG for a definition of the reference degree.
Based on the first major or field of study the respondent had declared or decided upon for the reference degree (X4REFDEG) as reported during the second follow up interview (X4RFDGMJ16 and X4RFDGMJ26, if applicable). Majors are classified using the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs, 2010 edition (CIP 2010) and then classified as STEM using the definition used by the SMART grant.  See X4RFMJSTNSF for a broader definition of STEM.
Note that X4RFDGMJSTEM is based on the "first major" (i.e. the major students reported first) for the undergraduate degree/certificate major field of study (X4RFDGMJ16); for students who had a double major for their undergraduate degree/certificate major field of study (see also X4RFDGMJ26), their "second major" (i.e. the major students reported second) does not impact the coding of X4RFDGMJSTEM.
Applies to: Second follow-up respondents who ever enrolled in an undergraduate degree or certificate program after high school.

Position:   2407
Length:     2
Label:      X4 Reference degree's first major is an NSF STEM field

Description:
Reference undergraduate degree/certificate first major field of study is major supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). See X4REFDEG for a definition of the reference degree.
Based on the first major or field of study the respondent had declared or decided upon for the reference degree (X4REFDEG) as reported during the second follow up interview (X4RFDGMJ16). Majors are classified using the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs, 2010 edition (CIP 2010) and then classified using the list of majors supported by NSF and their associated CIP codes available at https://webcaspar.nsf.gov/nsf/srs/webcasp/attribs/RFDISC2007_2009_2011.xls. See also X4RFDGMJSTEM  for a narrower definition of STEM.
Note that X4RFMJSTNSF is based on the "first major" (i.e. the major students reported first) for the undergraduate degree/certificate major field of study (X4RFDGMJ16); for students who had a double major for their undergraduate degree/certificate major field of study (see also X4RFDGMJ26), their "second major" (i.e. the major students reported second) does not impact the coding of X4RFMJSTNSF.
Applies to: Second follow-up respondents who ever enrolled in an undergraduate degree or certificate program after high school.

File:       STUDENT
Name:       X4RFDGMJ123
Position:   2411
Length:     2
Label:      X4 Reference degree major - 23 categories

Description:
Categorizes the reference degree (X4REFDEG) major into one of 23 categories. See X4REFDEG for a definition of the reference degree.
Based on the major or field of study the respondent had declared or decided upon for the reference degree (X4REFDEG) as reported during the second follow up interview. In the case of a double major, it is the major reported first. Majors were classified using the U.S. Department of Education's Classification of Instructional Programs, 2010 edition (CIP 2010) at the 6-digit level of specificity (X4RFDGMJ16) and then aggregated into 23 categories used in NCES' BPS, B&B, and NPSAS studies. For reference degrees that were bachelor's or associate's degrees that had not been completed by February 2016, see S4DECLAREMAJ to determine if the major had been declared. Related variables X4RFDGMJ2Y and X4RFDGMJ4Y further aggregate this variable into 11 and 10 categories to assist in analyzing subbaccalaureate and baccalaureate credential seekers' intended fields of study, respectively.

Applies to: Second follow-up respondents who ever enrolled in an undergraduate degree or certificate program after high school.

Label:      X4 Major for reference degree is initial considered major

Description:
Whether the major for the respondent's reference degree is the same as the major they were most seriously considering upon starting their postsecondary education.
Notes:  This variable draws on information from the HSLS second follow-up student-institution-program file (i.e. S4PSAMEMAJ where S4PREFDEG=1) to indicate whether the major for the respondent's reference degree is the same as the major they were most seriously considering upon starting their postsecondary education.  Students were asked if these majors were the same.  For more information on the major most seriously considered upon starting their postsecondary education, see S4FIELD, S4FIELD2, and/or S4FIELD6; for more information on the respondent's reference degree major, see X4RFDGMJ12 and/or X4RFDGMJ16.
Applies to: Second follow-up respondents where an intended major or field of study is named in S4FIELD on the student-level file and a major or field of study is named in S4PDEGMAJ on a student-institution-program file record where S4PREFDEG = 1.

Description:
Indicates the sample member's response status for the HSLS:09 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS).

Source: HSLS:09 Postsecondary Education Transcripts
Applies To: All students. 

Notes: A transcript was considered received if the transcript included degree, term, or course information. Incomplete transcripts were counted as received. For a small number of cases, one or more unknown/uncodable postsecondary institutions reported by sample members were found to be non-postsecondary institutions. Such postsecondary institutions have been removed from the student-institution pairs and did not factor into the construction of this variable. As a result, this variable may not be consistent with prior round variables that indicate postsecondary attendance. Further, if a student reported only unknown/uncodable postsecondary institutions in prior round interviews, they were assigned a value of 3.
